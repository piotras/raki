Simple example how to init custom transition and test it.

- midgard2.ini
Defines custom directory from which schema files will be loaded.
Those schemas should be Ratatoskr compatible, so no multilang types.
Sitegroup and lang fields should be defined explicitly.

- tests/phpunit.xml.dist
Initial file for phpunit.

- tests/ragnaroek_test_init.php
Initializes database to convert and test entry class.

- /data/ragnaroek/schema/
Location for original Ragnaroek schema files. Those are not loaded in PHP.
Instead they are parsed separately to generate SQL queries.
