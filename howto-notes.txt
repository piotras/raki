1. Clone raki project
2. Change directory to Ratatoskr
3. Dump production database and copy dump file to currrent location
4. Update transition-example.php script:
 * set correct database name
 * set correct database username and password
5. Copy schemas to data/schema directory (These schemas should contain all types you want to convert).
 * Update every type (from copied schemas) so it registers 'sitegroup' property explicitly
6. Copy all schemas to data/ragnaroek/schema directory.
 * Rename types. E.g. add ragnaroek_transition prefix.
 (These schemas are required to generate correct SQL queries, and are not used by extension itself)
7. Copy all schemas to /usr/share/midgard2 directory, so they can be used after migration.
8. Copy all configuration files from /etc/midgard/conf.d to /etc/midgard2/conf.d.
 * change [Database] section (to [Midgarddatabase])

Run:

    php -c midgard2.ini ./transition-example.php
